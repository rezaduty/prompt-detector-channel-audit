# Build the arXiv source tarball.
#
# arXiv rejects a PDF-only submission and runs its own TeX pass over the
# source, so the tarball must contain the source and must NOT contain the
# built PDF. Four things that make that pass fail are handled here:
#
#   1. the built PDF and the aux/log files are excluded, so arXiv cannot
#      mistake the PDF for the submission
#   2. Paper.bbl is included, so arXiv does not need to run bibtex
#   3. IEEEtran.cls and orcidlink.sty are bundled, in case the installed
#      TeX Live on arXiv differs from the one used locally
#   4. only .pdf figures are copied, since mixing .eps and .pdf in one
#      document breaks the automated pass
#
# The result is compiled in a clean directory before the tarball is written,
# using only the files that will be uploaded.
